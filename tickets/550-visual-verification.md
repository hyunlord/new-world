# T-550: Visual & HUD Verification [Low]

## Problem
- Need to confirm all visuals work after balance changes

## Checks
- Job shapes: circle(gatherer), triangle(lumberjack), square(builder), diamond(miner)
- Building shapes: stockpile(brown), shelter(orange), campfire(red)
- Construction progress: semi-transparent buildings
- HUD: Pop count, Food/Wood/Stone totals, entity panel

## Changes
- No code changes expected (already implemented)
- Verified by gate test

## Done Definition
- Gate passes
- Visual elements confirmed in code review

## Dependencies: T-500..T-540
