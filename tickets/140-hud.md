# 140 - HUD (Heads-Up Display)

## Objective
Create the CanvasLayer-based HUD with status bar and entity info panel, built entirely in code.

## Prerequisites
- 030-simulation-bus
- 020-game-config

## Non-goals
- No .tscn scene file (code-only for Phase 0)
- No minimap
- No event log viewer panel (console only)

## Files to create
- `scripts/ui/hud.gd`

## Implementation Steps
1. Create `scripts/ui/hud.gd` extending CanvasLayer
2. ```gdscript
   class_name HUD
   extends CanvasLayer
   ```
3. In `_ready()`, build UI tree programmatically:
   - **Top bar** (HBoxContainer at top):
     - Status label: "▶" or "⏸"
     - Game time label: "Y1 D1 H0"
     - Speed label: "1x"
     - Tick label: "Tick: 0"
     - Entity count: "Entities: 0"
     - Event count: "Events: 0"
     - FPS: "FPS: 60"
   - **Entity info panel** (PanelContainer, bottom-left, hidden by default):
     - Name label
     - Position label
     - Age label
     - Action label
     - Hunger bar (ProgressBar)
     - Energy bar (ProgressBar)
     - Social bar (ProgressBar)
     - Stats label (speed, strength)
4. Connect to SimulationBus signals:
   - tick_completed → update tick count, game time
   - speed_changed → update speed label
   - pause_changed → update status icon
   - entity_selected → show entity panel
   - entity_deselected → hide entity panel
5. `_process(_delta)`:
   - Update FPS label: Engine.get_frames_per_second()
   - If selected entity: update all entity info labels/bars
6. Style: Dark semi-transparent background, white text, monospace font
   - Use StyleBoxFlat for panel backgrounds
   - ProgressBars: red for hunger, yellow for energy, cyan for social

## Verification
- Gate PASS

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Top bar shows all status info
- [ ] Entity panel appears on selection
- [ ] Need bars update in real-time
- [ ] Dark semi-transparent styling
- [ ] Gate PASS

## Risk Notes
- Code-based UI is verbose but avoids .tscn dependencies
- @onready won't work since children are added in _ready()
- Must store references to labels as member variables

## Roll-back Plan
- Delete file
